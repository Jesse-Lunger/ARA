# ARA
SDS of original Project

ARA is a program used for not taking notes and then reciting those notes for memorization. See SDS for details.

Code will not be included in the repository because the code in this project was worked on independently and later combined. For
Every other repo I have linked, it is either purely my work, or work that I directly looked over and influenced.

For my contribution I worked on the document manager that repackaged jsons file to lists to be saved in a SQL database, in addition it would
save the information locally and update the database when connected. 

On request I can provide more information of my contribution in private.
